üëã Hi there. Welcome back to my page. This week, I had an opportunity to travel to Malaysia for the first time to physically attend and present at a reputed scientific conference, [IECBES 2022](https://www.iecbes.org/). That was a memorable event in my personal journey. Today, I will briefly summarize conference speeches and presentations in this highlights blog post. 

## 1. About IECBES 2022
The IECBES stands for IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, which is organized once every 2 years by The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS) Malaysia Chapter. The 7th IECBES with the major theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù was held in Kuala Lumpur from December 7th to 9th December 2022. 

Consistent with the theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù, the conference provided 6 keynote lectures and 7 invited speeches from leading academic scientists, along with 75 accepted papers, categorized into 11 tracks and one special session. Figure 1 illustrates the number of papers in each track.

**Insight 1**: As we can observe from Figure 1, Biomedical Signal Processing is the most attractive track, followed by Internet of Things in Biomedical Engineering and Healthcare, Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing, and Biomedical Instrumentation and Devices. Might be because we overcame the pandemic, the track Pre & Post COVID-19 Pandemic Response is less attractive and only has 2 accepted papers. 

## 2. Outstanding Papers
In this section, I will briefly introduce some outstanding papers that I found considerable. These papers also are in tracks I am interested in such as Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing, Biomedical Signal Processing, Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems, Pre & Post COVID-19 Pandemic Response, and Special Session - Trends in Smarter Healthcare: AI for Images. Some of these papers have been recognized as the Top 10 best papers. 

**Reconstruction of Fetal Head Surface from A Few 2D Ultrasound Images Tracked in 3D Space**<br>

in *Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing*<br>
> In this pilot study, we present a novel method to reconstruct the fetal head surface, from a small set of tracked 2D ultrasound images around the transthalamic brain plane. Indeed, 3D visualization of the fetus's prominent skull at the beginning of birth could help the obstetrician in decision-making to overcome dystocia, a delivery complication that results in labor obstruction. The use of 2D ultrasound images tracked in 3D would allow superimposing of the fetal head model to other reconstructed organs. However, fetal motion may affect the consistency of ultrasound images, in particular, if many frames are needed. Moreover, the fetal head is large at late pregnancy stages which causes occlusions in the ultrasound images. We thus propose and compare the performance of two different methods to reconstruct a fetal head surface from only 10 focused frames. Our best method achieves 1.6 mm of average reconstruction error in simulation based on an MRI dataset of 7 patients at 34-36 weeks of pregnancy. 

**Vector-Quantized Zero-Delay Deep Autoencoders for The Compression of Electrical Stimulation Patterns of Cochlear Implants Using STOI**<br>
by *Reemt Hinrichs; Felix Ortmann; J√∂rn Ostermann*<br>
in *Biomedical Signal Processing*<br>
> Cochlear implants (CIs) are battery-powered, surgically implanted hearing aids capable of restoring a sense of hearing in people suffering from moderate to profound hearing loss. Wireless transmission of audio from or to signal processors of CIs can be used to improve speech understanding and localization of CI users. Data compression algorithms can be used to conserve battery power in this wireless transmission. However, very low latency is a strict requirement, limiting severely the available source coding algorithms. Previously, instead of coding the audio, coding the electrical stimulation patterns of CIs was proposed to optimize the trade-off between bit rate, latency, and quality. In this work, a zero-delay deep autoencoder (DAE) for the coding of the electrical stimulation patterns of CIs is proposed. Combining for the first time bayesian optimization with numerically approximated gradients of anon-differential speech intelligibility measure for CIs, the short-time intelligibility measure (STOI), an optimized DAE architecture was found and trained that achieved equal or superior speech understanding at zero delays, outperforming well-known audio codecs. The DAE achieved reference vocoder STOI scores at 13.5 kbit/s compared to 33.6 kbit/s for Opus and 24.5 kbit/s for AMR-WB.
