ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Welcome back to my page, this is part 2 of my tutorial series on deploying Federated Learning on IoT devices. In the last article, we discussed what FL is and built a network of IoT devices as well as environments for starting work. Today, I will guide you step by step to train a simple CNN model on the CIFAR10 dataset in real IoT devices by using [Flower](https://flower.dev/). Let's get started.
