üëã Hi there. Welcome back to my page. This week, I had an opportunity to travel to Malaysia for the first time to physically attend and present at a reputed scientific conference, [IECBES 2022](https://www.iecbes.org/). That was a memorable event in my personal journey. Today, I will briefly summarize conference speeches and presentations in this highlights blog post. 

## 1. About IECBES 2022
The IECBES stands for IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, which is organized once every 2 years by The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS) Malaysia Chapter. The 7th IECBES with the major theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù was held in Kuala Lumpur from December 7th to 9th December 2022. 

Consistent with the theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù, the conference provided 6 keynote lectures and 7 invited speeches from leading academic scientists, along with 75 accepted papers, categorized into 12 sessions, including a special session on ‚ÄúTrends in Smarter Healthcare: AI for Images‚Äù. Figure 1 illustrates the number of papers in each session.

**Insight 1**: As we can observe from Figure 1, BioSig is the most attractive session, followed by IoT, BioImg, and BioIns. Might be because we overcame the pandemic, the session COVID-19 is less attractive and only has 2 accepted papers. 

## 2. Conference Details
In this section, I will briefly introduce some outstanding invited speeches and papers in such sessions that I understand including IoT, BioImg, BioSig, Cardio, COVID-19, and Special Session. 

### Internet of Things in Biomedical Engineering and Healthcare (IoT)

### Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing (BioImg)

### Biomedical Signal Processing (BioSig)

### Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems (Cardio)

### Pre & Post COVID-19 Pandemic Response (COVID-19)

### Special Session

## 3. Conclusion
