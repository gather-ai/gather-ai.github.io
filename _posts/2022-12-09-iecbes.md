üëã Hi there. Welcome back to my page. This week, I had an opportunity to travel to Malaysia for the first time to physically attend and present at a reputed scientific conference, [IECBES 2022](https://www.iecbes.org/). That was a memorable event in my personal journey. Today, I will briefly summarize conference speeches and presentations in this highlights blog post. 

## 1. About IECBES 2022
The IECBES stands for IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, which is organized once every 2 years by The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS) Malaysia Chapter. The 7th IECBES with the major theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù was held in Kuala Lumpur from December 7th to 9th December 2022. 

Consistent with the theme of ‚ÄúHealthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond‚Äù, the conference provided 6 keynote lectures and 7 invited speeches from leading academic scientists, along with 75 accepted papers, categorized into 12 sessions, including a special session on ‚ÄúTrends in Smarter Healthcare: AI for Images‚Äù. Figure 1 illustrates the number of papers in each session.

**Insight 1**: As we can observe from Figure 1, BioSig is the most attractive session, followed by IoT, BioImg, and BioIns. Might be because we overcame the pandemic, the session COVID-19 is less attractive and only has 2 accepted papers. 

## 2. Conference Details
In this section, I will briefly introduce some outstanding papers in such sessions that I understand including BioImg, BioSig, Cardio, COVID-19, and Special Session. 

### BioImg
**Reconstruction of Fetal Head Surface From a Few 2D Ultrasound Images Tracked in 3D Space**<br>

> In this pilot study, we present a novel method to reconstruct the fetal head surface, from a small set of tracked 2D ultrasound images around the transthalamic brain plane. Indeed, 3D visualization of the fetus's prominent skull at the beginning of birth could help the obstetrician in decision-making to overcome dystocia, a delivery complication that results in labor obstruction. The use of 2D ultrasound images tracked in 3D would allow superimposing of the fetal head model to other reconstructed organs. However, fetal motion may affect the consistency of ultrasound images, in particular, if many frames are needed. Moreover, the fetal head is large at late pregnancy stages which causes occlusions in the ultrasound images. We thus propose and compare the performance of two different methods to reconstruct a fetal head surface from only 10 focused frames. Our best method achieves 1.6 mm of average reconstruction error in simulation based on an MRI dataset of 7 patients at 34-36 weeks of pregnancy.
