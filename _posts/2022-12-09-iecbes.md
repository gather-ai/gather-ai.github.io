👋 Hi there. Welcome back to my page. This week, I had an opportunity to travel to Malaysia for the first time to physically attend and present at a reputed scientific conference, [IECBES 2022](https://www.iecbes.org/). That was a memorable event in my personal journey. Today, I will briefly summarize conference speeches and presentations in this highlights blog post. 

## 1. About IECBES 2022
The IECBES stands for IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, which is organized once every 2 years by The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE-EMBS) Malaysia Chapter. The 7th IECBES with the major theme of “Healthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond” was held in Kuala Lumpur from December 7th to 9th December 2022. 

Consistent with the theme of “Healthcare Personalisation: For the Future & Beyond”, the conference provided 6 keynote lectures and 7 invited speeches from leading academic scientists, along with 75 accepted papers, categorized into 12 sessions, including a special session on “Trends in Smarter Healthcare: AI for Images”. Figure 1 illustrates the number of papers in each session.
