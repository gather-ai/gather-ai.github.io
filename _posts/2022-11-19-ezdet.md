ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Welcome back to my page. In the last 2 tutorial series on [Domain Generalization](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/domain-generalization-part-1/) and [Federated Learning on IoT Devices](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/federated-learning-iot-part-1/), we dealt with 2 different types of classification (ECG classification and image classification), the most fundamental (and simple) task in Machine Learning (ML). Today, we will explore how to easily move from classification to object detection, a more advanced task in ML and Computer Vision. Let's get started. 

## 1. Background

### Motivation
I start this tutorial series and an open-source repository [ezdet](https://github.com/lhkhiem28/ezdet) by 3 following observations: 
* When people begin to learn ML, specifically Computer Vision, they typically begin with an image classification tutorial, such as [PyTorch's one](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). After that, they usually move to the object detection problem next, where the difficulty occurs. In particular, the tutorial on object detection in the community is not good and dissimilar from the one on classification. Therefore, people come to some open-source repositories like [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) from Ultralytics or [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Although these repositories are powerful, they still have their own drawbacks. 
* Available open-source repositories are very complex and equipped with many advanced techniques. This makes them not good starting points for people who just come to the term and want to understand object detection in a similar way as classification. Moreover, equipping many add-on techniques makes it difficult to fairly compare object detection models to each other. 
* These wonderful repositories are designed in a way that is not flexible enough for engineers and researchers to integrate object detection models into other ML projects. 

With the above observations, I created [ezdet](https://github.com/lhkhiem28/ezdet) to overcome these issues. Firstly, the ezdetâ€™s source code is organized in a similar way to the classification problem. Secondly, ezdet decouples the standard object detection process with other add-on techniques. Finally, ezdet can be easily integrated into other ML projects. At the end of this tutorial, we will embed ezdet into a Federated Learning project. 

### Object Detection
In this tutorial, the training data are assigned to the clients in an IID setting. As mentioned before, our network has 10 clients in total, the training data is shuffled and uniformly divided into 10 partitions, each with 5000 images for each client. Note that each partition might be doesn't include 500 images for each class.
