ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Welcome back to my page. In the last 2 tutorial series on [Domain Generalization](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/domain-generalization-part-1/) and [Federated Learning on IoT Devices](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/federated-learning-iot-part-1/), we dealt with 2 different types of classification (ECG classification and image classification), the most fundamental (and simple) task in Machine Learning (ML). Today, we will explore how to easily move from classification to object detection, a more advanced task in ML and Computer Vision. Let's get started. 

## 1. Background

### Motivation
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. Here are the classes in the dataset, as well as 10 random images from each:

### Object Detection
In this tutorial, the training data are assigned to the clients in an IID setting. As mentioned before, our network has 10 clients in total, the training data is shuffled and uniformly divided into 10 partitions, each with 5000 images for each client. Note that each partition might be doesn't include 500 images for each class. 

After assigning data to clients, let's implement a Dataset class, which will be used in a PyTorch DataLoader. 

```python
"""
Snippet 1: Dataset class. 
"""
from libs import *

class ImageDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, 
        df, data_path, 
        image_size = (32, 32)
    ):
        self.df, self.data_path,  = df, data_path, 
        self.image_size = image_size

    def __len__(self, 
    ):
        return len(self.df)

    def __getitem__(self, 
        index
    ):
        row = self.df.iloc[index]

        image = np.load("{}/{}.npy".format(self.data_path, row["id"]))
        image = cv2.resize(image, self.image_size)/255
        if len(image.shape) < 3:
            image = np.expand_dims(image, -1)

        return torch.tensor(image).permute(2, 0, 1), row["label"]
```
