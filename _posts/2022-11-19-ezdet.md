ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Welcome back to my page. In the last 2 tutorial series on [Domain Generalization](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/domain-generalization-part-1/) and [Federated Learning on IoT Devices](https://gather-ai.github.io/tutorials/federated-learning-iot-part-1/), we dealt with 2 different types of classification (ECG classification and image classification), the most fundamental (and simple) task in Machine Learning (ML). Today, we will explore how to easily move from classification to object detection, a more advanced task in ML and Computer Vision (CV). Let's get started. 

## 1. Background

### Motivation
I start this tutorial series and an open-source repository [ezdet](https://github.com/lhkhiem28/ezdet) by 3 observations: 
* When people begin to learn ML, specifically CV, they typically begin with an image classification tutorial, such as [PyTorch's one](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). After that, they usually move to the object detection problem next, where the difficulty occurs. In particular, the tutorial on object detection in the community is not good and dissimilar from the one on classification. Therefore, people come to some open-source repositories like [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) from Ultralytics or [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Although these repositories are powerful, they still have their own drawbacks. 
* Available open-source repositories are very complex and equipped with many advanced techniques. This makes them not good starting points for people who just come to the term and want to understand object detection in a similar way as classification. Moreover, equipping many add-on techniques makes it difficult to fairly compare object detection models to each other. 
* These wonderful repositories are designed in a way that is not flexible enough for engineers and researchers to integrate object detection models into other ML projects. 

With the above observations, I created [ezdet](https://github.com/lhkhiem28/ezdet) to overcome these issues. Firstly, the ezdetâ€™s source code is organized in a similar way to the classification problem. Secondly, ezdet decouples the standard object detection process with other add-on techniques. Finally, ezdet can be easily integrated into other ML projects. At the end of this tutorial, we will embed ezdet into a Federated Learning project. 

### Object Detection
Object detection is an advanced task in the CV field that deals with the localization and classification of objects contained in an image or video. For easy understanding, letâ€™s distinguish between image recognition and object detection. Image classification sends a whole image through a classifier for it to spit out a tag. Classifiers take into consideration the whole image but donâ€™t tell you where the tag appears in the image. Object detection is slightly more advanced, as it creates a bounding box around the classified object. Figure 1 illustrates this distinction.
