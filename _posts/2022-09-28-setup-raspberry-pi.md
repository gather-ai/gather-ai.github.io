ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Welcome back to my page. Recently, I have practiced implementing a real-world [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) setting on edge devices, not just simulation on a single machine. At first, I had to create a local network of edge devices, [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) computers in particular. It took me one day and a half to config everything with a lot of pain, therefore, I decided to start a new category on my page, [Engineering Pain](https://gather-ai.github.io/categories/#engineering-pain), to write down and share engineering things like this. Hope you find them useful.
