üëã Hi there. Welcome back to my page. Recently, I have practiced implementing a real-world [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) setting on edge devices, not just simulation on a single machine. At first, I had to create a local network of edge devices, [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) computers in particular, via [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) connections. It took me one day and a half to config everything with a lot of pain, therefore, I decided to start a new category on my page, [Engineering Pain](https://gather-ai.github.io/categories/#engineering-pain), to write down and share engineering things like this. Hope you find them useful.

## 1. Requirements
You need all of these things to start: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
* At least two Raspberry Pi, I use Pi 4 in my setting
* One micro SD card for each Pi
* One monitor, one mouse, and one keyboard
* An Ethernet switch
* A bunch of cables of various types

## 2. Boot OS into Pi
Firstly, we need to install Raspbian OS on X by following steps: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
* Plug your SD card into your computer (maybe via a reader USB)
* Download and use the [SD card formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) tool to format your card, this process will take a while, depending on card memory size

* Download and unzip [Raspbian](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_full_latest) from this link
* Download and use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to write OS into SD card

* Put SD card into Pi and turn it on, plug in a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, then do some simple steps to start working

## 3. Enable remote access
